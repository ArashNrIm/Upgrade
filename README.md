## Introduction
Welcome to **Upgrade**, the app for students to better understand their academic accomplishments.

Whether you're a beginner app developer or a student, I'd love adding on the number of users in this project. We plan to cater to all; however, I'm only focusing on developing the app in this current point in time. If you're a developer and wish to contribute, check out the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section below.

For designers, stay tuned for details coming soon!

## Branch `v1.0`

The branch you are currently in is the **`v1.0` branch**; all code related to the re-write of Upgrade is included here and kept separate from the `v2.0` branch to avoid conflicts.

- To view the source code for version 2.0, jump over to the [`v2.0` branch](https://github.com/arashnrim/Upgrade/).
- To view the branch with a release history, jump over to the [`releases` branch](https://github.com/arashnrim/Upgrade/tree/releases).

## Getting Started
First, thanks for your interest in the project! I'm glad that you'd like to contribute to the project. To begin, check out the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to see what you have to do, including structuring your commit message(s) and general rules-of-thumb that I recommended you to follow.

```print("We're working on installation instructions now; check back later!")```

## Support
If you need help with anything related to the project, I recommend opening a new issue in the Issue Tracker page. Following GitHub's [Open Source Guide](https://www.opensource.guide), I strongly advise against privately communicating.

## What's Ahead
Upgrade is a prototype app that I created about a year ago; now, I'm recreating it as a usable product that's free for anyone to use up in GitHub (that is, if anyone *wants* to use it). I don't have much goals for this project, but if you feel like you'd like to add something, I encourage you to do it!

## Contributing
Please review the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed elaborations of the how and what to contribute.
