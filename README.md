## Introduction
Welcome to **Upgrade**, the app for students to better understand their academic accomplishments.

Whether you're a beginner app developer or an innovator using the app, we'd love adding on the number of users in this project. We plan to cater to all; however, we're only focusing on developing the app in this current point in time. If you're a developer and wish to contribute, check out the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section below.

For designers, stay tuned for details coming soon!

## Getting Started
We're glad that you'd like to contribute to our project. To begin, check out our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to see what you have to do, including structuring your commit message and general rules-of-thumb that we recommended you to follow.

## Support
If you need help with anything related to the project, we recommend opening a new issue in the Issue Tracker page. Following GitHub's [Open Source Guide](https://www.opensource.guide), we strongly advise against privately communicating.

## What's Ahead
Upgrade is a prototype app that I created about a year ago; now, I'm recreating it as a usable product that's free for anyone to use up in GitHub. I don't have much goals for this project, but if you feel like you'd like to add something, I encourage you to do it!
