## Introduction
Welcome to **Upgrade**, the app for students to better understand their academic accomplishments.

Whether you're a student or someone just interested in FOSS projects, I'd love adding on the number of users in this project. I plan to cater to all; however, I'm only focusing on developing the app in this current point in time. If you're a developer and wish to contribute, check out the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section below.

For designers, stay tuned for details coming soon!

## Branch `v2.0`

The branch you are currently in is the **`v2.0` branch**; all code related to the re-write of Upgrade is included here and kept separate from the `v1.0` branch to avoid conflicts.

- To view the source code for version 1.0, jump over to the [`v1.0` branch](https://github.com/arashnrim/Upgrade/tree/v1.0).
- To view the branch with a release history, jump over to the [`releases` branch](https://github.com/arashnrim/Upgrade/tree/releases).

## Getting Started
Thanks for your interest in trying out this project! The explanation on how to get started is fairly long, so I've moved it to [the wiki](https://github.com/arashnrim/Upgrade/wiki/Building-Upgrade). Check it out to get started!

## Support
If you need help with anything related to the project, I recommend opening a new issue in the Issue Tracker page. Following GitHub's [Open Source Guide](https://www.opensource.guide), I strongly advise against privately communicating.

## What's Ahead
Upgrade is a prototype app that I created about a year ago; now, I'm recreating it as a usable product that's free for anyone to use up in GitHub (that is, if anyone *wants* to use it). I don't have much goals for this project, but if you feel like you'd like to add something, I encourage you to do it!

## Contributing
Please review the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed elaborations of the how and what to contribute.
This project **is accepting contributions**. If there's something broken or something you'd like to add, **fork the repository**, **create a branch** and **create a pull request** once you're done working.
