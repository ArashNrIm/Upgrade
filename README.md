## Introduction
Welcome to **Upgrade**, the app for students to better understand their academic accomplishments.

Whether you're a student or someone just interested in FOSS projects, I'd love adding on the number of users in this project. I plan to cater to all; however, I'm only focusing on developing the app in this current point in time. If you're a developer and wish to contribute, check out the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section below.

For designers, stay tuned for details coming soon!

## Getting Started
First, thanks for your interest in the project! I'm glad that you'd like to contribute to the project. To begin, check out the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to see what you have to do, including structuring your commit message(s) and general rules-of-thumb that I recommend you to follow.

If you'd like to try out this project on your end, let's get started!

### Setting Up

- [Direct clone/download](#direct-clone/download)
- [Cloning via Xcode](#cloning-via-xcode)

## Direct clone/download
1. Clone or download this project and save it somewhere accessible. If downloaded, unzip the file before you continue.

*Optional, but just in case:*

2. Install Cocoapods on your device by using `sudo gem install cocoapods` in Terminal.
3. Navigate to the Xcode folder of Upgrade (`Upgrade/Upgrade/`).
4. Enter `pod install` in Terminal.

## Cloning via Xcode
1. Open Xcode and select "Clone an existing project".
2. Enter `https://github.com/arashnrim/Upgrade.git` in the text field.
3. Select Clone and choose the branch `dev` to checkout to.
4. Save the project somewhere accessible.

*Optional, but just in case:*

5. Install Cocoapods on your device by using `sudo gem install cocoapods` in Terminal.
6. Navigate to the Xcode folder of Upgrade (`Upgrade/Upgrade/`).
7. Enter `pod install` in Terminal.

### Using the Xcode Project

- Always use `Upgrade.xcworkspace` instead of `Upgrade.xcodeproj`. The `xcworkspace` files has all the Cocoapods libraries installed.

### Contributing After

 - Ensure that your personal files (e.g., secrets, personal information, individual files) are ignored as much as possible.

## Support
If you need help with anything related to the project, I recommend opening a new issue in the Issue Tracker page. Following GitHub's [Open Source Guide](https://www.opensource.guide), I strongly advise against privately communicating.

## What's Ahead
Upgrade is a prototype app that I created about a year ago; now, I'm recreating it as a usable product that's free for anyone to use up in GitHub (that is, if anyone *wants* to use it). I don't have much goals for this project, but if you feel like you'd like to add something, I encourage you to do it!

## Contributing
Please review the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed elaborations of the how and what to contribute.
